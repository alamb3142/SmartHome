# SmartHome

## Project Status

This project is on hold until the Matter standard matures a bit more & I can get my hands on a few different types of Matter-Enabled device.

## About

A Smart Home system focusing on privacy and security. This project mainly serves as a demonstration of design practices rather than a commercially viable product, so the implementation may be a little thin.
