## First Draft

SmartHome users have `Device`s in their home to manage.

Each `Device` has one or `Control`s, for example a basic smart bulb will have `OnOff` controls, while a more advanced model may have `Level` and `Colour` controls.

Another example of a `Control` is a `Lock`, however this may fall under the same functionality as an `OnOff`.
